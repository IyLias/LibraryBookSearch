## TODO

***Step 1. revise source files to connect to kwu_library web site and parse datas from it*** 

- download jsoup library for internet network programming

- To parse html datas in kwu_library web site, organize the structure of web site

  **While parsing book datas, I have some problems**

    how to extract them?
    
  

- revise bookInfoParse java file for corresponding this web site

- revise mainActivity file for corresponding this web site

***Step 2. show search book datas in app***

- make proper layout for showing search book datas in one screen
   
  - apply scrollView to show many book datas in one screen
